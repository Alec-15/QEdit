Functions and commands

Including exporting




Blockly


I have to do this before I could install blockly (does the first do anything? following advice did the second as admin; check pythin is actually there for the third)
npm config set node_gyp


Blockly seems to use node-gyp. This is a library that offers a platform-neutral to native functions. On Windows, I had to first install windows build tools, which installed Python 2.7, and then tell npm where Python is.

npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
npm config set python C:\Python27\python.exe
npm install -g node-gyp



npm install node-blockly





Jitsi is free, just go to https://meet.jit.si/, and type in the meeting name, and you just connect to everyone else using that same name (you also need to install an app if using your phone). So far we are still working as normal at work, but I am anticipating people wanting to work from home, and I want to try this out.

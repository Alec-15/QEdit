Blockly


I have to do this before I could install blockly (does the first do anything? following advice did the second as admin; check pythin is actually there for the third)
npm config set node_gyp


Blockly seems to use node-gyp. This is a library that offers a platform-neutral to native functions. On Windows, I had to first install windows build tools, which installed Python 2.7, and then tell npm where Python is.

npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
npm config set python C:\Python27\python.exe
npm install -g node-gyp



npm install node-blockly
